## Why Zigbee 3.0

Zigbee 3.0 increases choice and flexibility for users and developers, and delivers the confidence that products and services will all work together through standardization at all layers of the stack.  The Zigbee 3.0 solution includes testing, certification, branding and marketing support to make it easier to develop and sell interoperable products and solutions. It unlocks growth opportunities while fueling innovation to enable new capabilities at home, work and on the road.

Zigbee 3.0 is built on the Zigbee PRO, which enhances the IEEE 802.15.4 standard by adding mesh network and security layers along with an application framework and to become a full stack, low-power certifiable, interoperable Zigbee solution.
